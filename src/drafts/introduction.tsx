            My research interests lie in human-computer interaction (HCI) and
            visualization. I view myself as a system-HCI researcher: I am
            interested in investigating{" "}
            <b>
              how humans interact with
              (user-facing/expert-facing/sociotechnical) systems
            </b>
            . In my past works, I have prototyped, engineered, and evaluated
            systems supporting various cognitive tasks, including
            reading/writing, sensemaking, and decision-making. Through those
            works, I have gathered a broad spectrum of skills and research
            methods -- from training AI models to building interactive systems,
            from quantitative to qualitative research.

            Fun facts about me: 1) before deep diving into new knowledge, I love
            to approach it with first-order intuitions, hence my love for
            narrating insights with visualizations; 2) I usually prefer my
            interface to be direct manipulation, even in the age of chatbots; 3) besides research, I am a
            car/aviation enthusiast: I watch motorsport races and sim race F1/WRC machines.{" "}

            I am now a master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego.
            Before, I graduated with honors from Tongji University, majoring in
            Computer Science and Technology. I have broad experience in HCI and
            AI topics from research and industry. Previously, I worked closely
            with

            and interned with the

              text="AVA team"
            />{" "}
            at Ant Group. I hosted (and am now hosting) several undergraduate
            (interest-driven) research projects about HCI at Tongji University
            with support from

            />
            , resulting in award-winning projects and publications. I am also a
            research assistant at the Human-Centered AI Lab at Northeastern
            University, working on projects advised by
            <OuterLink

            />
            . More recently, I have extended my extremities towards more
            system-HCI-related topics, including the domains of programming
            language, social media, and health.
