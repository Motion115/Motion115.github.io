            My research interests lie in human-computer interaction (HCI) and

            systems for reading/writing, sensemaking, and decision-making.
            Through those works, I have gathered a broad spectrum of skills and
            research methods -- from training AI models to building interactive
            systems, from quantitative to qualitative research.

            I am now a master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego.
            Before, I graduated with honors from Tongji University, majoring in
            Computer Science and Technology. I have broad experience in HCI and
            applied AI topics from research and industry. I strive to build
            long-term, collaborative relationships with my mentors, learning
            from their expertise while contributing my own capability to shared
            goals:

                HCI. Such efforts have resulted in award-winning publications at

              Fun facts: 1) before deep diving into new knowledge, I love to
              approach it with first-order intuitions, hence my love for
              narrating insights with visualizations; 2) I usually prefer my
              interface to be direct manipulation, even in the age of chatbots;
              3) besides research, I am a car/aviation enthusiast: I watch
              motorsport races and sim race F1/WRC machines.{" "}
