            student from UC San Diego. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree
            in Computer Science from Tongji University.

            make sense of rich information, with the vision of applying them in
            critical societal domains such as healthcare. I research by making:
            I use human-centered design methods to identify task-specific needs;
            I leverage theories from human cognition and technical advances from
            visualization and artificial intelligence to inform system design;
            and I rigorously evaluate the systems through mixed-method user
            studies.

              Fun facts: 1) before deep diving into new knowledge, I love to
              approach it with first-order intuitions, hence my love for
              narrating insights with visualizations; 2) I usually prefer my
              interface to be direct manipulation, even in the age of chatbots;
              3) besides research, I am a car/aviation enthusiast: I watch
              motorsport races and sim race F1/WRC machines.{" "}
