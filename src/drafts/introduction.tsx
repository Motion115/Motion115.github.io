            My research interests broadly lie in human-computer interaction
            (HCI), specifically <b>human-AI interaction</b>. I am interested in
            engineering systems and toolkits that enhance human (lay users and
            domain experts) capabilities through interacting with AI
            technologies (NLP, CV, etc.). I aspire to approach human-AI
            interaction by exploring the design of information-based interfaces
            powered by AI's knowledge representation capabilities while
            investigating the human affordances for such systems. I hope to make
            technical and empirical contributions to fields such as{" "}
            <b>visualization</b> and{" "}
            <b>user interface software and technology</b>.

            I am now a master's student in Computer Science at UC San
            Diego. Previously, I graduated with honors from Tongji University,
            majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I have previous
            experience in both research and industry with topics related to HCI
            + AI research. Previously, I worked closely with
